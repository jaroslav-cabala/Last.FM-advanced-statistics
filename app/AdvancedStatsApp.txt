What this app will do ? Advanced statistics.
    - Artist discovery - which artists did you discover in a specific time period, number of scrobbles, list of discovered albums of this artist...
    - Album discovery - which albums did you discover in a specific time period, number of scrobbles...
    - Which artists/albums/tracks did user scrobble x times the fastest ? (a line chart would be cool).
      E.g. album Samsara was scrobbled 600 times in 31 days, album Planetary Clairvoyance was scrobbled 600 times in 1 year
    - Top artists/albums/tracks by scrobble time
    - Top albums by rate of how evenly the album was scrobbled. I.e it distinguished between albums where majority of scrobbles comes from 20% of songs
      and where scrbbles were more evenly distributed between every song


Details to implementation:
    - I will most probably need to store some(probably lots of data) in local storage or something like that. so it is persisted forever on user machine
      and I don't need to download the data every time statistics are generated(that would be probably not ok with last.fm, overloading their api)
